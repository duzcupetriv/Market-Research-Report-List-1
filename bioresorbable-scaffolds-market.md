<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Scaffolds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal-based Bioresorbable Scaffold</li><li>Polymer-based Bioresorbable Scaffold</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioresorbable scaffolds market is divided into two primary types: metal-based and polymer-based scaffolds. Metal-based bioresorbable scaffolds are typically made from materials like magnesium or iron, offering mechanical strength and gradual absorption in the body. In contrast, polymer-based bioresorbable scaffolds utilize biodegradable polymers, providing flexibility and superior biocompatibility. Both types support tissue regeneration by serving as temporary structures that dissolve over time, reducing long-term foreign body reactions while promoting healing and integration with surrounding tissues.</p></p>
