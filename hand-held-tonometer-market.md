<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hand-held Tonometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hand-held tonometer market is divided into two main types: contact and non-contact tonometers. Contact tonometers require direct contact with the eye, using a small probe to measure intraocular pressure, often providing precise readings. In contrast, non-contact tonometers utilize a puff of air to measure eye pressure without touching the eye, making them more comfortable and suitable for quick screenings. Both types serve essential roles in glaucoma detection and overall eye health monitoring, catering to different patient needs.</p></p>
