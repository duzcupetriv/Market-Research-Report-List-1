<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Methylmethacrylate (MMA) Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Adhesives</li><li>Thermoplasticity Adhesives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Methylmethacrylate (MMA) adhesives market comprises two primary types: thermosetting and thermoplastic adhesives. Thermosetting adhesives cure into a rigid structure through a chemical reaction, offering excellent durability and resistance to heat and solvents, making them suitable for permanent bonding applications. In contrast, thermoplastic adhesives remain pliable and can be re-melted upon heating, allowing for flexibility and the ability to form strong bonds without permanent fixation. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs, including automotive, construction, and aerospace sectors.</p></p>
