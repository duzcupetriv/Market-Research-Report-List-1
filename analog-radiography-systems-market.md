<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analog Radiography Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Film Based</li><li>CR Film Cassette</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Analog radiography systems primarily include film-based and computed radiography (CR) film cassette technologies. Film-based systems utilize traditional X-ray films to capture images, requiring chemical processing for development. In contrast, CR film cassettes use photostimulable phosphor plates to capture images, which are later digitized using a CR reader. This allows for enhanced image quality, reduced processing time, and the possibility of digital archiving. Both systems cater to diverse medical imaging needs, although digital solutions are increasingly preferred.</p></p>
